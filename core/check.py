def acl(ctx: commands.Context) -> bool:
    """ACL check function.

    :param ctx: The command context.

    :return: The ACL result.

    If the invocating user is bot owner, the access is always allowed.
    To disallow the invocation in DMs (e.g. the function uses ``ctx.guild``
    without checking and handling the error state), use
    ``@commands.guild_only()``.

    .. note::
        Because discord.py's :class:`~discord.ext.commands.Bot` method
        :meth:`~discord.ext.commands.Bot.is_owner()` is a coroutine, we have to
        access the data directly, instead of loading them dynamically from the
        API endpoint. The :attr:`~discord.ext.commands.Bot.owner_id`/
        :attr:`~discord.ext.commands.Bot.owner_ids` argument may be ``None``:
        that's the reason pumpkin.py refreshes it on each ``on_ready()`` event
        in the main file.

    If the context is in the DMs, access is always denied, because the ACL is
    tied to guild IDs.

    The command may be disabled globally (by setting :attr:`guild_id` to `0`).
    In that case :class:`False` is returned.

    Then a database lookup is performed. If the command rule is not found,
    access is denied.

    If the rule has user override (explicit allow, explicit deny), this override
    is returned, and no additional checks are performed.

    If the user has no roles, the default permission is returned.

    User's roles are traversed from the top to the bottom. When the first role
    with mapping to ACL group is found, the search is stopped; if the role isn't
    mapped to ACL group, the search continues with lower role.

    If the highest ACL-mapped role contains ACL information (e.g. MOD allow),
    this information is returned. If the group isn't present in this rule,
    its parent is looked up and used in comparison -- and so on, until decision
    can be made.

    If none of user's roles are found, the default permission is returned.

    To use the check function, import it and include it as decorator:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from core import acl, utils

        ...

        async def repeat(self, ctx, *, input: str):
